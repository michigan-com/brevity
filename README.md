Brevity [![Build Status](http://ci.renvy.com/job/brevity_prod/badge/icon)](http://ci.renvy.com/job/brevity_prod/)
======

Brevity allows us to track and monitor how our tokenizer and summarizer work against our news articles.
We currently see it as a testing ground where we can vote on which sentences
we think are the best "summaries" for any given article as well as tease out
any bugs with sentence boundaries.  This tool allows us to view a direct comparison
against our summarizer "bot" (click on an article then click on "show annotations")
which in theory will help us improve our bot over time based on human input.
